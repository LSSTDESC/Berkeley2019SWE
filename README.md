# Collaborative software development in Python

Dark Energy school: session on Software Engineering

## Course preparation

0. Install Python version 3.5 or newer. Install the dependencies for
   this course using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  Run `python
   check_setup.py` to verify your installation.
1. Install an editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Ensure you can execute commands on the terminal / shell.  E.g.,
   commands such as `python`, `git`, and `pytest` should run.
3. Read [How To Write Good Scientific Software](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/download/attachments/240262679/good-scientific-software-notes.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1550801976000&api=v2).

## Schedule

15:15–17:00

End with 15 mins. Q&A, if time allows.

## Outcomes

### General

- Discuss best practices for design & collaborative coding.
- How do you best organize a remote collaboration?  Meetings, PRs,
  sprints, chat?
- Discuss classes vs functions; when is OOP needed in practice?  Keep
  it simple—the truth about clever code.  Premature optimization.
- How to package your code (vs just keeping it in a notebook)

Students will be able to do the following:

### Git/GitHub

1. Make and navigate branches on Git
2. Make a git commit to a project
3. Submit your change as a pull request on GitHub
4. Review someone else's pull request

### Modular APIs, testing

1. Write a function in Python
2. Write a docstring for that function
3. Write a test for that function + corner cases
4. Execute those tests locally
5. Have Travis-CI run these tests online
6. Develop your own Python package, installed using
   `pip install -e .`.
