# Berkeley2019SWE

Dark Energy school: session on Software Engineering

## Schedule

15:15–17:00

## Outcomes

### General

- Discuss best practices for design & collaborative coding.
- How do you best organize a remote collaboration?  Meetings, PRs,
  sprints, chat?
- Discuss classes vs functions; when is OOP needed in practice?  Keep
  it simple—the truth about clever code.  Premature optimization.
- How to package your code (vs just keeping it in a notebook)

Students will be able to do the following:

### Git/GitHub (audience semi-familiar with this topic?)

1. Make and navigate branches on Git
2. Make a git commit to a project
3. Submit your change as a pull request on GitHub
4. Review someone else's pull request

### Modular APIs / testing

1. Write a function in Python
2. Write a docstring for that function
3. Write a test for that function + corner cases
4. Execute those tests locally
5. Have Travis-CI run these tests online
6. Develop your own Python package, installed using
   `pip install -e .`.
